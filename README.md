# VictronmqtttoC-
Result: Re-usable asset for victron mqtt in C#

Just a simple class that has most of the elements that victron publishes to topics. Its an autogenerated file and the generator made some mistakes so... use at your own peril. 

The generator and monitor produced the class,

Use the monitor first, update the topic if need be and the IP of the broker in the file

It should produce this
topic_patterns.txt

Then run the ClassGenerator and it will consume the file and produce "output_classes.cs" which wont be perfect as it will leave unresolved items unfinished. But it
will be a good start to import. I noticed some lists are correctly finished and sometimes it leaves and extra > when defining types. 

I'm not going to put too much effort in to this at this stage as it doesnt do much for me. but it might be helpful for others.
